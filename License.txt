Intentions

I (ReportMill) intend for SnapKit to be free for any use that needs
it to be free. However, I would like to retain the hope/possibility
of generating income to fund continued development - if ever a
commercial entity of sufficient means, other than ReportMill, finds
value in it.

Please interpret that liberally. If you have any doubt, send me a note
and I will issue a waiver/license for your use case.

If you are a wealthy commercial entity in need of a license, contact
us directly to best determine a solution to meet your needs and
provide for the health and future of this project.
